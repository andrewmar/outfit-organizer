## Getting Started

To get started with the Wardrobe Organizer App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database available for use. Create a new database that the Wardrobe Organizer App will utilize.
3. Configure your database connection string using dotnet secrets(more info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows)). You can store sensitive information like connection strings using dotnet user-secrets for enhanced security.
4. Run the application using your IDE or terminal.
5. All available endpoints could be checked using swagger while in development environment on this address http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
